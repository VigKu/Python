## Passwork Checker

Given a string, write a function to determine if it is a legitimate *Password*, satisfying the following conditions: 
- (i) length between 8 and 24,    
- (ii) at least one uppercase character,    
- (iii) at least one lowercase character,    
- (iv) at least one digit,     
- (v) at least one special character amongst `!@#%&*`, and    
- (vi) no spaces in between.      

The function should accept a `string` as input, and return `True` or `False` according to the conditions.     
You may want to check all "methods" (functions) in the `string` class to find the ones you need in this case.
